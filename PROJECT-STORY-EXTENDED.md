# Personal AI Knowledge Platform - Full Project Story, Commands, and Deep Dive

## 1. Project Idea
This project is a Personal AI Knowledge Platform. The goal is to let anyone upload PDF documents and then "chat" with them using AI. For example, you could upload a textbook and ask questions about it, and the AI would answer using the content of your PDF.

## 2. How We Started
We wanted to use only free or very low-cost cloud resources, so we chose AWS (Amazon Web Services) and built everything using their free tier. We also wanted the project to be easy to use, secure, and scalable. We started by planning the architecture and listing all the features we wanted.

## 3. Main Technologies Used (and Alternatives)
- **AWS Lambda**: Runs our backend code (Python). Alternative: AWS EC2, AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Functions.
- **API Gateway**: Lets the frontend talk to the backend. Alternative: AWS Application Load Balancer, direct Lambda URLs.
- **S3**: Stores uploaded PDFs. Alternative: Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage.
- **DynamoDB**: Stores metadata and AI embeddings. Alternative: AWS RDS, MongoDB Atlas, Firebase.
- **Cognito**: Handles user login and registration. Alternative: Auth0, Firebase Auth, custom JWT.
- **Google Gemini API**: Provides the AI answers. Alternative: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, AWS Bedrock.
- **FAISS**: Finds the most relevant chunks of text. Alternative: Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate.
- **React**: The web frontend. Alternative: Vue.js, Angular, Svelte.

## 4. Project Structure & Why Each File Exists (with Alternatives)

## 5. How We Created Each Part (with Full Commands)
### Infrastructure
We started with AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) to define all resources in one file. This makes it easy to deploy everything at once. We used YAML because it's readable and supported by AWS.

**Commands:**
- `sam init --runtime python3.13 --name pai-platform` (Initialize SAM project)
- `sam build` (Build the project)
- `sam deploy --guided` (Deploy with prompts)
- `aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name pai-stack --template-body file://infra/.aws-sam/build/template.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --region ap-south-1` (Manual deployment)

### Backend
We wrote Python Lambda functions for upload and query. The upload function:
- Accepts a PDF
- Extracts text
- Splits text into chunks
- Gets AI embeddings for each chunk
- Stores everything in DynamoDB

**Commands:**
- `zip upload.zip upload.py` (Zip Lambda code)
- `aws s3 cp upload.zip s3://pai-pdf-storage/upload.zip --region ap-south-1` (Upload code to S3)
- `aws lambda create-function --function-name pai-upload --runtime python3.13 --role <role-arn> --handler upload.lambda_handler --code S3Bucket=pai-pdf-storage,S3Key=upload.zip --layers <layer-arn> --timeout 60 --memory-size 512 --region ap-south-1` (Create Lambda)

The query function:
- Accepts a question
- Finds the most relevant chunks using FAISS
- Sends those chunks and the question to Gemini AI
- Returns the answer

**Commands:**
- `zip query.zip query.py`
- `aws s3 cp query.zip s3://pai-pdf-storage/query.zip --region ap-south-1`
- `aws lambda create-function --function-name pai-query --runtime python3.13 --role <role-arn> --handler query.lambda_handler --code S3Bucket=pai-pdf-storage,S3Key=query.zip --layers <layer-arn> --timeout 60 --memory-size 512 --region ap-south-1`

### Lambda Layer (for big dependencies)
- `pip install faiss-cpu numpy PyPDF2 requests -t python/` (Install dependencies)
- `zip -r pai-faiss-layer.zip python/` (Zip layer)
- `aws s3 cp pai-faiss-layer.zip s3://pai-pdf-storage/pai-faiss-layer.zip --region ap-south-1`
- `aws lambda publish-layer-version --layer-name pai-faiss-layer --description "FAISS, numpy, PyPDF2, requests" --content S3Bucket=pai-pdf-storage,S3Key=pai-faiss-layer.zip --compatible-runtimes python3.13 --region ap-south-1` (Create layer)

### Frontend
We built a React app with:
- Login/Register (using Cognito)
- File upload UI
- Chat interface

**Commands:**
- `npx create-react-app frontend`
- `cd frontend`
- `npm install amazon-cognito-identity-js react-router-dom --legacy-peer-deps`
- `npm start`

### IAM & Security
We created a dedicated IAM user for deployment, with only the permissions needed. We used scripts to automate this and avoid using the root account.

**Commands:**
- `aws iam create-user --user-name pai-deployment-user`
- `aws iam create-role --role-name pai-lambda-role --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json`
- `aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name pai-lambda-role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`
- `aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name pai-lambda-role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess`
- `aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name pai-lambda-role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess`

### Cognito
**Commands:**
- `aws cognito-idp create-user-pool --pool-name pai-user-pool --region ap-south-1`
- `aws cognito-idp create-user-pool-client --user-pool-id <pool-id> --client-name pai-client --no-generate-secret --region ap-south-1`

### DynamoDB
**Commands:**
- `aws dynamodb create-table --table-name pai-embeddings-metadata --attribute-definitions AttributeName=doc_id,AttributeType=S --key-schema AttributeName=doc_id,KeyType=HASH --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST --region ap-south-1`

### S3
**Commands:**
- `aws s3 mb s3://pai-pdf-storage --region ap-south-1` (Make bucket)

### API Gateway
**Commands:**
- `aws apigatewayv2 create-api --name pai-api --protocol-type HTTP --region ap-south-1`
- `aws apigatewayv2 create-route --api-id <api-id> --route-key "POST /upload" --target integrations/<integration-id> --region ap-south-1`
- `aws apigatewayv2 create-route --api-id <api-id> --route-key "POST /query" --target integrations/<integration-id> --region ap-south-1`

## 6. Problems We Faced & How We Solved Them
- **IAM Permissions**: AWS is very strict about permissions. We kept getting errors like "not authorized to perform cloudformation:CreateChangeSet". We solved this by creating and attaching the right policies and using a dedicated IAM user.
- **Lambda Size Limits**: Lambda functions have strict size limits. Our code was too big because of dependencies like FAISS and numpy. We solved this by moving all big dependencies to a Lambda Layer and only uploading our code.
- **SAM Transform Errors**: IAM users sometimes can't deploy SAM templates due to missing permissions. We worked around this by deploying resources manually and using the AWS Console when needed.
- **API Gateway Integration**: Connecting Lambda functions to API Gateway can be tricky. We used the AWS Console to wire up the endpoints and triggers.
- **Cognito Client Secret Issues**: Cognito sometimes creates clients with secrets, which breaks frontend login. We made sure to set `GenerateSecret=false`.
- **Region Consistency**: We always used `ap-south-1` to avoid cross-region issues.
- **Frontend Dependency Conflicts**: React and its libraries sometimes have version conflicts. We used `--legacy-peer-deps` to fix npm install errors.

## 7. How a 10-Year-Old Can Understand This Project
Imagine you have a big book and you want to ask it questions, like "What is the capital of France?" Instead of reading the whole book, you upload it to a website. The website uses a robot (AI) to read the book for you and answer your questions. The robot is very smart and can find the answer quickly, even if the book is very big.

We built this website using tools that let us store your book, remember who you are, and let the robot answer your questions. We made sure everything is safe, fast, and doesn't cost much money.

## 8. Why This Project Is Special
- You can chat with any PDF you upload
- It uses the latest AI technology
- It's secure and respects your privacy
- It runs almost for free on AWS
- Anyone can use it, even if they're not a tech expert

## 9. What You Can Do Next
- Upload your own PDFs and chat with them
- Share the platform with friends
- Add more features (like support for images or other file types)
- Learn how cloud and AI work together

## 10. Final Thoughts
This project shows how you can use cloud, AI, and modern web tools to build something useful for everyone. We faced many challenges, but by breaking problems into small steps and using the right tools, we built a working Personal AI Knowledge Platform.

If you want to build your own, just follow the guide, use the commands, and don't be afraid to ask for help!
